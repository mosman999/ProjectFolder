'docker login' The command "docker login" is used to authenticate and log in to a Docker registry.

'docker build -t <tag> .'The command "docker build -t" is used in Docker to build a new Docker image with a specified tag. Here's a breakdown of the command:

"docker build": This is the Docker command to build a new image. It takes a Dockerfile and the necessary context to create the image.

"-t": It is a flag used to specify the tag for the image. The tag is a way to give a meaningful name to the image, typically in the format "repository:tag". The tag can be used to identify different versions or variations of the image.
